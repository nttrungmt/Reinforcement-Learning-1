# Diving into Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

### Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Action Spaces

This post attempts to accomplish three things:

1. Intuition behind deterministic policy gradients
2. Derivation of deterministic policy gradients 
3. Implementation of deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG)
